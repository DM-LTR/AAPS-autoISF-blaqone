 * Deliberately separate from [advancedFilteringSupported]: that list also gates SMB and AutoISF's raw
 * fit, so adding a source there has wider effects than a source-specific estimator input needs.
 *
 * Sibionics reports a sensor-state-calibrated observation every minute; AiDex, Libre 2/3 and
 * Ottai/Syai also deliver one-minute readings. A sender that forwards only every fifth minute still
 * gets the 5-minute profile.

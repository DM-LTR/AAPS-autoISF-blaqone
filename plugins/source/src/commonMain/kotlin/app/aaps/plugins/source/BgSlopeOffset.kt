/**
 * AutoISF fork: a fixed correction of incoming CGM values, `value × slope + offset` (offset in mg/dL).
 *
 * ONLY slope and offset. No smoothing and no calibration window: smoothing stays with the chosen
 * smoothing plugin (UKF). Meant for a sensor that reads a fixed amount too high or too low, for example
 * a Libre 3 that is 30 mg/dL off.
 *
 * Slope 1.0 and offset 0 leave the value exactly as it is. A value that is not above zero (no value) is
 * never changed, and a corrected value is never below 40 mg/dL, as in AutoISF 3.2.1.
